# A Short Introduction of Myself
Hello, this is **Vivian Lei**.
I am a second-year student at the college, majoring in *English Language & Literature* and *Sociology*. 
I am from Yunnan Province, China, but I currently live in Chicago.

Here are several things I enjoy doing:

1. Watching movies from the last century;
2. Playing video games with friends;
3. Sleeping for 10 hours on a Saturday.

Here are some of my favorite animals: 

+ Cats
+ Red pandas
+ Penguins
